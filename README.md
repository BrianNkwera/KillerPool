# The killer pool rules

1. There are a total of 11 balls numbered from 7 to 17;
2. The balls must be potted in order from 7 to 17;
3. Each ball carries points equal to its number. For example the 7ball carries 7 points.
4. When a player pots a ball points of that ball are added to the player's score.
5. The game ends when the remaining points on the table are less than the differnece between the highest score and the second highest score of the players;
